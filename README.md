## Setup
* Start by configuring your product endpoint, credentials, and parameters in `lib\constants\AppConstants`.
* **Alternatively**, use the free endpoint provided below (as of the sharing date) for successful testing.
```dart
class AppConstants {
  // Replace "YOUR_API_PREFIX" with your own API base URL.
  static const String BASE_URL = "YOUR_API_PREFIX";
  static const String API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"; //IF_EXIST

  // For testing, use the free API base URL from the released version
  static const String BASE_URL = "https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v2";

  // Project owner full name.
  static const String projectOwnerName = "FULL_NAME";
}
```

## Notice
* To use your own API endpoints, customize logical layers following MVVM architecture guidelines based on your API documentation.
* Certain images in the pre-released version were removed due to copyright restrictions.
